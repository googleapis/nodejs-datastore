/**
 * A partition ID identifies a grouping of entities. The grouping is always
 * by project and namespace, however the namespace ID may be empty.
 *
 * A partition ID contains several dimensions:
 * project ID and namespace ID.
 *
 * Partition dimensions:
 *
 * - May be `""`.
 * - Must be valid UTF-8 bytes.
 * - Must have values that match regex `[A-Za-z\d\.\-_]{1,100}`
 * If the value of any dimension matches regex `__.*__`, the partition is
 * reserved/read-only.
 * A reserved/read-only partition ID is forbidden in certain documented
 * contexts.
 *
 * Foreign partition IDs (in which the project ID does
 * not match the context project ID ) are discouraged.
 * Reads and writes of foreign partition IDs may fail if the project is not in an active state.
 *
 * @property {string} projectId
 *   The ID of the project to which the entities belong.
 *
 * @property {string} namespaceId
 *   If not empty, the ID of the namespace to which the entities belong.
 *

 * A unique identifier for an entity.

 *
 * @property {Object} partitionId
 *   Entities are partitioned into subsets, currently identified by a project
 *   ID and namespace ID.
 *   Queries are scoped to a single partition.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [PartitionId]{@link google.datastore.v1.PartitionId}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} path
 *   The entity path.
 *   An entity path consists of one or more elements composed of a kind and a
 *   string or numerical identifier, which identify entities. The first
 *   element identifies a _root entity_, the second element identifies
 *   a _child_ of the root entity, the third element identifies a child of the
 *   second entity, and so forth. The entities identified by all prefixes of
 *   the path are called the element's _ancestors_.
 *
 *   An entity path is always fully complete: *all* of the entity's ancestors
 *   are required to be in the path along with the entity identifier itself.
 *   The only exception is that in some documented cases, the identifier in the
 *   last path element (for the entity) itself may be omitted. For example,
 *   the last path element of the key of `Mutation.insert` may have no
 *   identifier.
 *
 *   A path can never be empty, and a path can have at most 100 elements.
